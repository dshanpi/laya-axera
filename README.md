# Laya-AXERA

**Open-weight typed decisions, running on AXERA edge NPUs.**

Python inference for the [AXERA-TECH/Laya](https://huggingface.co/AXERA-TECH/Laya) AXModel
checkpoints through [PyAXEngine](https://github.com/AXERA-TECH/pyaxengine), with a web demo:
a decision playground, Snake, Flappy Bird, Tetris, Breakout, and Star Rescue.

**~31 ms** per question with the multilingual checkpoint on one AX8850 (AXCL). **0 output
tokens.** No PyTorch, no Transformers runtime, no cloud API — tokenization uses Hugging
Face's Rust tokenizer and the encoder runs entirely on the NPU.

Laya is a bidirectional decision model: it answers constrained questions over text or
structured state in one forward pass, without generating text.

- `choice`: probabilities over 2–4 named options.
- `score`: probabilities over 2–4 ordered rubric levels and their expected score.
- `noul`: P(true) for a proposition.

## Star Rescue Commander

A space rescue game with animated flight paths, shields and rescue beams. Laya selects
rescue, evade, refuel or return on the NPU. The dashboard shows raw action probabilities,
risk, immediate-return probability, and measured inference time. Inject storms or fuel
leaks, edit the mission, or compare a fixed-rule pilot and manual control on the same seed.

Open `/rescue.html` after starting the server. See the
[deployment guide and measured results (Chinese)](docs/rescue.zh-CN.md).

Model choices and guard interventions are reported separately. The current checkpoint
can return prematurely; the guide reports this behavior alongside successful delivery.

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Provider | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AX8850 board (on-chip) | `AxEngineExecutionProvider` | aarch64, NPU3 |
| x86/arm64 host + AXCL card (PCIe / M.2) | `AXCLRTExecutionProvider` | `device_id` picks the card |

The provider is selected automatically; pass `provider=` to force one.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dshanpi/laya-axera.git
cd laya-axera
pip install -e '.[web]'
```

PyAXEngine is not on PyPI — install the `axengine` wheel from
[pyaxengine releases](https://github.com/AXERA-TECH/pyaxengine/releases) on the device or
host first. `tokenizers>=0.21` is required to parse the ModernBERT / mmBERT tokenizer files
(the wheel that ships with Transformers 4.41 is too old).

Download the model package (three checkpoints, ~1.5 GiB):

```bash
hf download AXERA-TECH/Laya --local-dir models/Laya
```

| Checkpoint | Backbone | NPU latency per question | Recommended use |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `english/` | ModernBERT-large | ~70 ms on-chip, ~74 ms AXCL | English routing, guardrails, triage |
| `multilingual/` | mmBERT-base | ~28 ms on-chip, ~31 ms AXCL | Chinese and other languages |
| `typed-decisions/` | ModernBERT-large | ~70 ms on-chip, ~74 ms AXCL | Invoice, security, agent-trace workflows |

Latencies measured with `python examples/bench.py <checkpoint>`: on-chip on an AX8850 dev
board (multilingual 28.8 ms, english 71.1 ms, PyAXEngine, models NFS-mounted), AXCL on an
idle x86 host card. The Snake demo asks three questions per move, so one move costs about
three question latencies.

## Python API

```python
import laya_axera as laya

agent = laya.load("models/Laya/multilingual")   # device_id=0, provider auto-selected
result = agent.predict(
    "发票4411重复扣款，请今天退还多扣的金额，否则我们会取消服务。",
    {
        "department": {
            "type": "choice",
            "instructions": "这条请求应由哪个团队处理？",
            "criteria": {"billing": "扣款与退款", "technical": "故障报错", "sales": "价格采购"},
        },
        "urgency": {
            "type": "score",
            "instructions": "这条请求有多紧急？",
            "criteria": ["常规", "尽快", "今天必须解决"],
        },
        "refund": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "用户是否明确要求退款？"},
    },
)
print(result["answers"]["department"]["choice"])        # billing
print(result["total_npu_latency_ms"])
```

`system_one` is an alias for `predict`; `predict_request` takes the packaged
`{"state": ..., "questions": ...}` request objects unchanged. States can be text or JSON
records. The answer schema (choice / probabilities / score / legend / noul / confidence /
`action.act_probability`) follows upstream Laya and the packaged `axllm` runtime, plus a
measured `npu_latency_ms` per question.

## CLI

```bash
# one request file (same format as the packaged sample_request.json)
laya-axera run models/Laya/multilingual --input models/Laya/multilingual/sample_request.json

# resident JSON Lines mode: one request per line, /exit stops
laya-axera run models/Laya/multilingual --device 1

# web demo on port 8010, all three checkpoints, lazy-loaded on first use
laya-axera serve --root models/Laya --port 8010
```

## Web demo

`laya-axera serve` hosts a five-view page plus a JSON API. One resident checkpoint
answers for all of them:

- **决策台 / Decisions** — edit state + questions, run them on the NPU, read the answers as
  probability bars with per-question latency. One click loads the board-validated sample
  request of the selected checkpoint.
- **打方块 / Breakout** — the planner predicts where the ball will cross the paddle row
  and describes left / right / hold; the model picks one per step, ~30 ms. Probed over
  every rotation of which action is best, the three-way choice lands on the intended
  action at 0.62-0.78, and in playtests it tracked the planner on 400/400 steps.
- **Flappy Bird** — one binary decision per step (flap or glide), one NPU question at
  ~30 ms: the planner describes each action's consequence, the model picks, and the
  optional shield corrects only fatal proposals.
- **俄罗斯方块 / Tetris** — the planner shortlists four placements; the model rates each
  one independently with a noul question over a uniform Chinese statement (probe-selected:
  choice-style ranking suffers heavy label bias in this domain) and the highest P(good)
  placement is played. ~126 ms per piece, four NPU questions. A manual mode adds
  ◀▶/A/B controls: you place, the model rates your move and shows its own pick.
- **贪吃蛇 / Snake** — the laya-mlx Snake demo, served to the browser. Every move asks the
  resident checkpoint three questions (move / risk / food) on the NPU; a deterministic cycle
  safety shield can correct unsafe proposals, and every intervention is counted and shown.
  About 10 moves/s with the multilingual checkpoint on one AXCL AX8850.

| Endpoint | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/info` | Version, default checkpoint, load status |
| `GET /api/samples/{name}` | Packaged sample request of a checkpoint |
| `POST /api/predict` | `{model?, state, questions}` → answers |
| `POST /api/snake/new` | `{model?, seed?, guarded?, prompt?}` → session |
| `POST /api/snake/step` | `{session}` → one Laya-decided move |
| `POST /api/{flappy,tetris,breakout}/new` | `{model?, seed?, guarded?}` → session |
| `POST /api/{flappy,tetris,breakout}/step` | `{session}` → one Laya-decided move |
| `POST /api/tetris/place` | `{session, rotation, col}` → your move, rated against the model's |

Every game rail carries a dimmed control pad that lights up with the action the model
executed, and the game loops play back the physics frames the server actually ran.

**决策台 / Decisions** — four typed questions over one support ticket

**打方块 / Breakout** — left / right / hold, one question per step

## Parity with the board-validated outputs

All three checkpoints reproduce the packaged `sample_output.json` recorded with `axllm` on
an AX8850 board: identical selected labels, and probabilities matching to 4 decimals
(e.g. multilingual: billing 1.0000, urgency 1.9359, refund 0.9925, churn 0.9400).
Run the checks yourself on a device:

```bash
pytest tests/test_common.py                                   # hardware-free
LAYA_AXERA_MODEL_DIR=models/Laya/multilingual pytest tests/   # on NPU
```

## Packaged graph constraints

The AXModels are fixed-shape: batch 1, 256 tokens, up to 4 options, one NPU forward per
question. Longer contexts and batched questions exist upstream but are outside this release.
Probabilities can shift after quantization; validate thresholds on representative data
before automating high-impact actions.
